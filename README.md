# Deep learning methods for solving ordinary differential equations

This work focuses on two primary deep learning methods for solving ordinary differential equations: 
- Physics-informed neural networks,
- Deep Euler method.

We theoretically examine both methods and evaluate their performance using examples from real physical systems. Additionally, we propose a correction to the physics-informed neural network for a specific ODE system. We analyze various neural network architectures and method parameters to assess the impact of different components on their performance.

The project consists of:
- folder PINN with notebooks with experiments with physics-informed neural networks done in Python,
- folder DE with notebooks with experiments with Deep Euler method done in Python,
- Master thesis.
